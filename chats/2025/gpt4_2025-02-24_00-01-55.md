Using IrfanView command line, save F:\temp\file.bmp into PNG quality 90%
same folder but extension is different

GPT-4o mini:
To convert a BMP file to a PNG file with a quality setting of 90% using IrfanView from the command line, you can use the following command:

```bash
i_view64.exe "F:\temp\file.bmp" /convert="F:\temp\file.png" /resample=(0,0) /convert_quality=90
```

Make sure to replace `i_view64.exe` with the correct path to your IrfanView executable if it's not in your system's PATH. 

### Explanation of the command:
- `i_view64.exe`: This is the executable for IrfanView. Use `i_view32.exe` if you are using the 32-bit version.
- `"F:\temp\file.bmp"`: This is the path to the input BMP file.
- `/convert="F:\temp\file.png"`: This specifies the output file path and name.
- `/resample=(0,0)`: This option is used to maintain the original size of the image.
- `/convert_quality=90`: This sets the quality for the output PNG file.

### Note:
- PNG is a lossless format, so the quality setting may not have a significant effect as it would with lossy formats like JPEG. However, the command is structured to include it for compatibility with other formats.
